This is a simple PGN writer with auto-complete. I found existing options to be great for analyzing or watching games, but unergonomic when one wants merely to *transcribe* them.

Currently the board is only a preview, you cannot enter moves by dragging the pieces. It also doesn't support PGN headers, as this is focused only on transcribing the moves. I recommend copying the resulting PGN into a more capable tool like lichess for creating detailed PGNs.
